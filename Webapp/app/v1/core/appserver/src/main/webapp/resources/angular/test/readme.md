To run tests:

<1> you need to install node.js first on your local machine

<2> go to the directory that contains package.json file

<3> use npm install to install all the dependencies

<4> go to the directory that contains the karma.config.js

<5> use karma start karma.config.js to run the test

Notice: Please read karma.config.js, modify the test files' path if necessary since the there is many
changes everyday, don't not change the order of the items because it matters.
