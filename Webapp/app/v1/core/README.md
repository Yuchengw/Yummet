# Yummet
Development Environment.

Please Contribute the Master branch very carefully, otherwise, be careful of your kneecaps;)

For current spring modules, we have the parent project:
yummet, the core projects, it has three sub-modules:
appserver ( app + angular)
platform (middle layer + DB)
tool (devops)

So, the current structure tree is :

yummet [core] ---
                |----appsever[app]
                |----platform [platform]
                |----tool[devops]
